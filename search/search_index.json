Planning for retirement shouldn't be dreaded and avoided. The statement \"failing to plan is planning to fail\" is just as applicable to retirement as it is to other aspects of life. The most often asked question regarding retirement is \"will the money last\" . Retirement Planner software helps to answer that and other questions. This tool can be used to create a forty year plan beginning with a retirement start year of your choice. Retirement Planner software provides multiple capabilities to assist with tasks that are necessary to aid in creating an informed retirement plan. This planning tool attempts to address major topics that are important to understanding what retirement will possibly look like for years to come. Plan for the future not the past This software is designed to plan for the future and not track the past. The plan is always created with a current or going forward timeframe concept. The target year for retirement must either be the current year if already retired or a future start year. A target retirement start year prior to this year is not supported and cannot be entered. Even if you retired one or more years in the past the software uses the current year as the starting year for planning purposes. What Retirement Planner does not provide Retirement Planner does not provide any investment strategies or track historical performance of investments. How the plan is created The overall objective of Retirement Planner is to determine if the money will last. Data e.g. budget, income, assets, etc. must be entered and then analyzed over a period of time. The budget needs are weighed against the available income and investments. Along with all of the data entered Retirement Planner proivdes three points of control and adjustment in creating a plan. The points of control are 1) Retirement Year, 2) Average Rate of Return, and 3) Annual Inflation Rate. These controls are associated Individuals, Income, and Expenses. With Retirement Planner you are able to increase or decrease these points of control to understand the effects on your retirement plan. In real life some of these factors can be controlled. At other times these factors are out of your control. Before and After tax monies Most retirees will have some funds in a tax deferred account e.g. 401(k), 403(b), and will be required to pay tax on these funds when withdrawn. As there are tax implications and IRS Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) concerns Retirement Planner attempts to deal with these issues. When entering data for the INVESTMENTS section of the Assets tab the owner of the acccount and the classification (before/after tax) is required. More information about the impacts of these issues is described in the following sections. Withdrawal amount calculation Retirement Planner uses a \"matching value\" approach to calculate the withdrawal amount that is needed for each year. The matching occurs when available income is matched to the annual budget needs to calculate a withdrawal amount. Income tax calculation Income tax rate tables are provided in this software for single and married filing status for Federal and all States plus D.C. Current provided tax rate tables are based on the 2021 year. County and City income tax rates my be entered on the 'TaxRates' tab if applicable. The filing status and state to calculate taxes are selected by use the drop-down menus on the Individuals tab. Press the 'Update tax tables' button to create the formulas for calculating the income taxes. Taxes are calculated during the process when the green calculator icon is pressed. From the Individuals and Income tabs the detail view for all income taxes can be accessed. The detail view TaxRates tab is where County and City tax rate tables are defined. IRS Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) calculation If there are any Before tax monies available and the calculated annual withdrawal amount is less than the IRS Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) amount the annual budget and withdrawal amounts are increased to satisfy the RMD amount. This increase is handled internal to the calculation and not shown in the Budget tab. The additional funds withdrawn to meet the RMD amount are taxed at the effective tax rate for that year. The remainder of the withdrawal funds, after taxes are taken out, are transferred to 'After tax' investments for future use. Based on the date of birth for individuals 1 and 2 the RMD required start age is 70 if born before July 1, 1942 or start age of 72 if born after that date. Monthly Income sources Using the Income tab multiple sources of monthly income can be defined with start and end years, COLA (Cost of Living Adjustments), and percent taxable. Use of the start and end years provides the flexibility to define when the income is expected to stop or start. Thus supporting when one ends work and begins drawing a pension, Social Security, Railroad Retirement, etc. The percent taxable is essential to aid in calculating the proper income taxes. Defining an annual COLA percent for each source provides a means to increase future incomes. Two additional income sources, Rental and Supplemental can be defined. Rental is the calculated monthly income from rental property if defined. Rental income is defined using on the Rental tab which is accessed from the Assets and Income tabs. Supplemental income is defined as a annual amount on the Income tab. Examples for supplemental income are: inheritance, profits from sale of vehicle, etc. Home sale calculation If a house is owned, and will be sold at specific year, defined in the Selling Home section of the Housing tab, there is an adjustment made to the budget removing all existing house expenses from the sale year forward. All line items in the 'HOUSING' section of the Budget tab are what is removed from the budget. This removal of expenses should be offset with new housing costs that will be included in the budget. These new costs are entered on the 'Living expense after sale of home' section of the Housing tab.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"assets/","text":"Note Now is the time to get stuff done.
