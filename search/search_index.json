Planning for retirement shouldn't be dreaded and avoided. The most often asked question regarding retirement is \"will the money last\" . Retirement Planner software helps to answer that and other questions. Whether you are early or late in the planning process it needs to be done. The statement \"failing to plan is planning to fail\" is just as applicable to retirement as it is to other aspects of life. This software can be used to create a forty year retirement plan. Many events and aspects of life will impact the quality of retirement. What the future holds for one in retirement is unknown. Yet, one can be prepared and educated about the challenges and opportunities of retirement. A knowledgeable and sound retirement plan will definitely help now and in the future. Though this software is titled Retirement Planner is can and has been used to assit with making financial descions for decades before retirement. Whether What Retirement Planner does not provide Retirement Planner does not provide any investment strategies or track historical performance of investments. This software is not designed to replace the value of professional financial advise. Plan for the future not the past This software is designed to plan for the future and not track the past. The plan is always created with a current or going forward timeframe. The target year for retirement must either be the current year or a future year. A target retirement start year prior to this year is not supported and cannot be entered. Even if you retired one or more years in the past the software uses the current year as the starting year for planning purposes. Points of control Along with all of the data entered Retirement Planner proivdes three points of control and adjustment in creating a plan are provided. The points of control are 1) Retirement Year, 2) Average Rate of Return, and 3) Annual Inflation Rate. These controls are associated with Individuals, Income, and Expenses. Retirement Planner allows modifing, increasing or decreaseing, of these points of control to understand the effects on the retirement plan. In real life some of these factors can be controlled. At other times these factors are out of our control. How the plan is created The overall objective of Retirement Planner is to determine if the money will last. Data e.g. budget, income, assets, etc. must be entered and then analyzed over a period of time. The budget needs are weighed against the available income and investments. The following image shows the flow of how the retirement plan is generated. The generation starts calculations with the retirement year beginning values for budget, before tax investments, and after tax investments. Each subsequent year of the forty year plan will use a newly calculated and adjusted values. If the investment balance falls below the needed withdrawal for that year a popup message is displayed and calculations for following years are terminated. The termination of calculations does not mean the plan has failed. This may be appropriate if the last year of successful calculations meets the retirement needs. If one is 85 years old and the plan is able to calculate for 20 years then terminate for most this would be considered a successful retirement. If the last successful plan year does not meet the needs it is time to begin making adjustments e.g. decrease budget needs, invest to get higher rate-of-return, possibly adjust inflation rate, can sale of house help, etc. Features of Retirement Planner Before and After tax monies Most retirees will have some funds in a tax deferred account e.g. 401(k), 403(b), and will be required to pay tax on these funds when withdrawn. As there are tax implications and IRS Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) concerns Retirement Planner attempts to deal with these issues. When entering data for the INVESTMENTS section of the Assets tab the owner of the acccount and the classification (before/after tax) is required. More information about the impacts of these issues is described in the following sections. Withdrawal amount calculation Retirement Planner uses a \"matching value\" approach to calculate the withdrawal amount that is needed for each year. The matching occurs when available income is matched to the annual budget needs to calculate a withdrawal amount. Notice in the following diagram that some information can impact Income and Expenses. For example while owning an asset e.g. home, car, etc. there will be expenses incurred to maintain the asset, yet the same asset is considered income when sold. Income tax calculation Income tax rate tables are provided in this software for single and married filing status for Federal and all States plus D.C. Current provided tax rate tables are based on the 2021 year. County and City income tax rates my be entered on the 'TaxRates' tab if applicable. The filing status and state to calculate taxes are selected by use the drop-down menus on the Individuals tab. Press the 'Update tax tables' button to create the formulas for calculating the income taxes. Taxes are calculated during the process when the green calculator icon is pressed. From the Individuals and Income tabs the detail view for all income taxes can be accessed. The detail view TaxRates tab is where County and City tax rate tables are defined. IRS Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) calculation If there are any Before tax monies available and the calculated annual withdrawal amount is less than the IRS Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) amount the annual budget and withdrawal amounts are increased to satisfy the RMD amount. This increase is handled internal to the calculation and not shown in the Budget tab. The additional funds withdrawn to meet the RMD amount are taxed at the effective tax rate for that year. The remainder of the withdrawal funds, after taxes are taken out, are transferred to 'After tax' investments for future use. Based on the date of birth for individuals 1 and 2 the RMD required start age is 70 if born before July 1, 1942 or start age of 72 if born after that date. Monthly Income sources Using the Income tab multiple sources of monthly income can be defined with start and end years, COLA (Cost of Living Adjustments), and percent taxable. Use of the start and end years provides the flexibility to define when the income is expected to stop or start. Thus supporting when one ends work and begins drawing a pension, Social Security, Railroad Retirement, etc. The percent taxable is essential to aid in calculating the proper income taxes. Defining an annual COLA percent for each source provides a means to increase future incomes. Two additional income sources, Rental and Supplemental can be defined. Rental is the calculated monthly income from rental property if defined. Rental income is defined using on the Rental tab which is accessed from the Assets and Income tabs. Supplemental income is defined as a annual amount on the Income tab. Examples for supplemental income are: inheritance, profits from sale of vehicle, etc. Home sale calculation If a house is owned and will be sold, as defined in the Selling Home section of the Housing tab, there is an adjustment made to the budget by removing all existing house expenses from the sale year forward. All line items in the 'HOUSING' section of the Budget tab are what is removed from the budget. This removal of expenses should be offset with new housing costs that will be included in the budget. These new costs are entered in the 'Living expense after sale of home' section of the Housing tab.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"adjust/","text":"Retirement Planner software provides several capabilities to enter and modify data. This topic will provide information about what data can or should be changed to evaluate possible what if options in the plan. As mentioned in the Welcome topic of this documentation there are three points of contorl provided 1) Retirement Year, 2) Average Rate of Return, and 3) Annual Inflation Rate. Other than adjusting these points of control what other ways are there to evaluate the what if of retirement. The following topics discuss control points and user entered data for expenses and income. Expenses Control Point The software automatically adjusts the annual expenses to increase by the inflation rate. Adjusting the annual inflation rate can either increase or decrease expenses based on the adjustment. Use the colored chevrons on the Home or Retire tabs to adjust the annual inflation rate. User entered data The Budget tab is the primary tab to enter expenses. Though more than one tab is used to enter expenses and taxes. Consider the following: Tab Describe Entry / Action Budget Expenses are occuring now. Enter in the Budget tab using the standard input fields. Ensure the expense amount and annual frequency are correct. Budget One or more expenses will be different at retirement. For the specific line item on the Budget tab use the field in the column (+/-) Monthly Adjust at Retirement to modify the expense amount. To properly adjust the budget ensure the value is entered as a monthly amount. Housing Transportation Med-Insur Expenses have increased for the category. From the Budget tab select the pencil icon for the appropriate tab. Modify the expenses as needed. Retire After retirement starts the annual budget needs to increase or decrease for a single year. From the Retire tab, in the column titled Single Year Monthly Budget Adj. (+/-) , locate the year the adjustment is needed and enter the monthly adjusment amount. Example adjustments: * Increase in medical insurance premiums till Medicare is available. * Increase the budget to cover car payments. If finance over a period of years create adjustments for multiple years. * Decrease the budget because a one time rebate will be received. Retire After retirement starts the annual budget needs to increase or decrease for all future years. From the Retire tab, in the column titled Multi-year Monthly Budget Adj. (+/-) , locate the start year for the adjustment and enter the monthly adjusment amount. Example adjustments: * House mortgage will be paid off. * Planning to sell a car, boat, or other property. * Project a slow down in activities as one ages. Rental Rental property maintenance costs are increasing. Access the Rental tab from either the Assets or Income tabs. For the appropriate rental property modify the field(s) Annual Repairs and/or Expenses Increase % to reflect the increase. This change to annual repairs will impact the calculated Yearly Net Income for the associated rental property and the net amount will be reflected on the Income tab. With information form the Income tab used to calculate the Retirement Plan. Individuals Income tax filing status or state has changed. From the drop-down selection fields Status and/or State on the Individuals tab modify the tax filing information. TaxRates City or County taxes have changed. From either the Individuals or Income tab click the pencil to open Detail Tax Data. Modify the city or county taxes as required. The button labeled 'Update tax tables' must be pressed to update the tax calculation formulas. RMD related expenses During the plan generation the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) withdrawal amount may not be met requireing an adjustment of additional funds needing to be withdrawn from Before tax investments. Taxes for this adjustment amount will be subtracted from the total adjustment amount and the net difference added to the After tax balance for future use. Avoid the 50% penalty An RMD is the annual Required Minimum Distribution that you must start taking out of your retirement account after you reach age 70 or 72. If you are born after July 1, 1949 the trigger date moves from 70 to 72. The RMD amount is determined by the fair market value of your before tax funds at the end of the previous year, factored by your age and life expectancy. The IRS penalty for not taking an RMD, or for taking less than the required amount, is steep: 50% of the amount not taken on time. The deadline to take your first RMD is normally April 1 of the year after you turn 72, and December 31 each following year. Income Control Point Adjusting the average rate of return (RoR) by using the colored chevrons on the Home or Retire tabs. Increasing ROR by a half a percent can have significant impact over time. While increasing RoR is important it may be equally important to understand how low of a RoR one can accept before having a negative impact. A lower RoR often means a lower risk profile and less impact to funds when markets User entered data Two tabs, Income and the Investments section of Assets tab are used to enter most income. The Rental property is defined that will also impact income. Tab Describe Entry / Action Income Receiving a pension and Social Security benefits. Enter both sources of income on the Income tab. Ensure the taxable percentage is properly set for the Social Security benefits. Income Currently employed and plan to change jobs in the next year or two. Enter the current job salary on the Income tab and the estimated year to quit. Enter the anticipated new job start year, salary, and percent of increase as a second source. Assets Getting a 4% RoR for a 401(k) that gets annual contributions of $15,000 In the Investments section of the Assets tab enter the Category Item ID, current 401(k) balance, expected RoR or 4%, annual contribution of $15,000, select Before Tax, and select the correct owner. Press the eyeball icon on the left-hand side of this section to view the estimated future value of this investment. Rental Rental property has monthly rent of $1,200. From the Rental section of the Assets tab click the pencil icon on the left-hand side to open the Rental tab. For the appropriate property modify the field Monthly Rent . If there is an annual increase that should also be entered in the Annual rent increase % field.","title":"Working with the plan"},{"location":"download/","text":"Retirement Planner The following link can be used to download the Retirement Planner software spreadsheet.

Answer From the Retire or Home tabs click the colored chevrons for the Average Rate of Return. Once modified re-calculate the plan and review the impact to the Investment Balance and timeframe. Question I expect to received an iheritance within the next few years. What's the best way to add this to the plan? Answer From the Assets tab add a new item to the Investments section for the inheritance. This will most likely be defined as After tax income and can be defined as owned by an individual or as joint. Question It's a new year, what changes need to made to keep the plan up to date? Answer When this software is opened on the computer in the new year the Retirement planning year on the Individuals tab will automatically update to the current year.

NOTE: It is recommended to generate an updated plan between each of the above tasks to validate the change was made successfully. Use the green calculator icon on the Home or Retire tabs to generate the updated plan. Question When the plan is generating the message that all calculations have stopped is shown, what should I do? Answer Review the Retire tab and locate the last year where there is a dollar amount in the column titled Annual withdrawal from Investment . First, don't ignore the message and hope for the best. If this year is far enough in the future and you don't expect to live past this year all is fine. If this year is not far enough in the future you will need to explore how to either increase income or reduce expenses. Income: If you have a home and can possibly sell it explore what might be a good year for the sale to generate additional income. The sale of the home is entered in the Housing tab which can be accessed from the Assets tab. Discuss with a financial planner or research if you can get a better rate of return on investments. Expenses: Review any expenses that are classified as Optional and determine if they can be reduced or deleted. Question I'm not close to retirement age why would I use this software? Answer Though the softwre title is Retirement Planner this software can be useful for financial planning well before you start planning for retirement. A few examples of use might be: Help understand how much money is needed each month by using the Budget tab. Determine how the current inflation rate will impact your budget next two years. Can you afford to buy a car and rent a new apartment? If I save $2,500 a year and get 5% return what will I have in ten yoars?","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"overview/","text":"Starting the software Note All screen images shown in this documentation are taken while using Microsoft \u00ae Excel for Mac.
