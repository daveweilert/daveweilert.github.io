<p>My Retirement Plan                          </p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">    Instructions                    

    This spread sheet is provided to assist in understanding and planning future or current retirement.  Multiple tabs providing several features are included to enable one to collect categories of information.  These categories include Assets and Liabilities, Investments, Budget, Retirement, and Useful Facts.  Information about each of these tabs follows.                  

    (1) Instructions  -   the tab being read.  Describes how to use this spread sheet and enter data to produce the retirement finance  model.              
    (2) Assets &amp; Liabilities  -    use this tab to define primary assets and liabilities.  Entries from this tab populate portions of the Investments and Budget tabs.  This tab also provides high-level overview net and gross worth.             
    (3) Investments  -  use this tab to estimate future investment contributions and rate of returns.  Up to six investments that are entered on the Assets &amp; Liabilities tab can be defined.  This tab is also used to define what is defined as &#39;House Buy Down&#39;.  If payments are being made for a mortgage the estimated monthly buy down of the mortgage can be entered.  This monthly amount is totaled for the year and that total is added to the total value of all investments.               
    (4) Budget  -   this tab is used to define the current monthly budget.  The defined &#39;Inflation Rate&#39; from the Retirement tab is used to calculate the estimated budget for the target retirement start date.  This start date is also obtained from the Retirement tab.                 
    (5) Retirement  -  this tab is where data is entered and the retirement modelling happens. Several input fields are available to define the Income, Budget, and Withdrawals that will be used for each year of retirement.  These fields also allow defining Social Security benefits and housing related data.  Modeling and What-If can be performed on this tab.  Up to five different scenarios can be created, saved, and loaded.              
    (6) Useful Facts  -   this tab provides useful facts regarding past inflation, consumer price index, Social Security cost of living adjustments, federal tax rates , etc.  This data can help determine what is a valid or logical value for some of the entry fields on the Retirement tab.                
    Detailed information and instructions for each of the above mentioned tabs is provided in the following sections.

Bother entries have comments indicating these issues.&quot;              </p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">    Investments                 

    &quot;This tab is populated with data from the Assets &amp; Liability and Retirement tabs.

<p>The annual total for all investment columns is shown the  field labeled &#39;Balance of All Investments&#39;.  &quot;                    </p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">        Displaying of investments on this tab will change based on the information entered on the &#39;Assets &amp; Liabilities&#39; tab.

<p>For each line item of the budget four fields can be defined a.) Description, b.) Annual Freq., c.) Inflation Applies, d.) Expense Amount.  Example Descriptions have been provided, yet can be changed as needed.  The field &#39;Annual Freq.&#39; defines the number of times the expense occurs for the year.  Valid values are 0 to 366.  Inflation Applies will control if this expense should have inflation calculated for each year till retirement.  Expense amount is the dollar amount for the defined expense and frequency.</p>

<p>Two additional fields can optionally defined for each line item.  The &#39;(+/-) Monthly Adjust at Retirement&#39; field is used to increase or decrease the line item when the target year for retirement is reached.  If this field contains a positive or negative value the cell will be color coded.  Green for positive amounts and Red for negative amounts. &quot;                   </p>
